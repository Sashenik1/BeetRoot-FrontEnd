                <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey!
                    If you're looking for environment setup instructions, they've
                    moved to <u>their own section.</u> Continue reading for an introduction

                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
                    applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles.
                    With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs
                    as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using
                    React components: <span class="ital"> bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>. You can learn
                    more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
                    components work in React Native.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user
                           interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps
                           to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                    <li>
                        <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="fat">+ components</span>. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
                           friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="fat">+ JSX</span>. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside 
                           JavaScript like so:  <span class="gray"> &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;.</span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. 
                           Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring 
                           a <span class="gray">name </span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces
                           inside <span class="gray"> &lt;Text&gt; </span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="fat">+ props</span>. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="fat">+ state</span>. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how 
                           components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is 
                           useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
                           State gives your components memory!</p>

                        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
                           It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the
                           text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when
                           the text is submitted.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words
                           into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written 
                           the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
